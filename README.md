# AI Chef Personality Assignment

## Overview

This assignment involves creating a set of AI personalities to simulate chefs from different backgrounds. Each personality will handle user requests related to dish suggestions, recipe details, and recipe critiques, based on a predefined personality profile. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can simulate distinct personalities and provide relevant culinary advice.

## Project Structure

### 1. AI Chef Personalities
Each script features a unique AI chef with a distinct personality. The personalities include:

- **Experienced Kenyan Chef:** Known for being short-tempered but highly knowledgeable, offering precise and detailed recipes.
- **Old Ugandan Grandma (Jajja Maria):** A warm, traditional cook who provides caring and constructive feedback, with a focus on Ugandan classics.
- **(Optional Additional Personalities):** Depending on the assignment, you may add more personalities, such as a seasoned Italian chef or a young Indian chef specializing in Biryani.

### 2. Input Scenarios
Each AI chef is programmed to handle three specific types of user inputs:
- **Ingredient-Based Dish Suggestions:** The AI will suggest up to three dish names based on the provided ingredients.
- **Recipe Requests:** The AI will provide a detailed recipe for a specified dish name.
- **Recipe Critiques:** The AI will critique a provided recipe and suggest improvements.

### 3. Code Implementation
Each script follows a similar structure:
- A system prompt defines the AI chef’s personality.
- User input is gathered based on one of the three scenarios.
- The AI processes the input and provides a response according to the predefined personality and logic.
- The conversation loop allows for continuous interaction with the AI.

### 4. Experiment Procedure
The assignment involves running three separate scripts, each handled by a different team member:
1. **First Team Member:** Uses the first script to suggest a dish based on given ingredients.
2. **Second Team Member:** Uses the second script with a different personality to request a detailed recipe for the suggested dish.
3. **Third Team Member:** Uses the third script with another personality to critique the provided recipe and suggest improvements.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Set up the OpenAI API Key:**
   - Ensure that your environment is configured with the `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script in your preferred Python environment.
   - Follow the prompts to input ingredients, request a recipe, or submit a recipe for critique.

3. **Interact with the AI:**
   - Engage in a conversation with the AI chef according to the scenario assigned to you.
   - Share the AI’s responses with your group members for further steps.

## Example Scenario

For the **Old Ugandan Grandma (Jajja Maria):**
- **Input:** A recipe for "Matoke with Groundnut Sauce."
- **AI Response:** Constructive feedback to enhance the flavor and authenticity of the dish.

## Conclusion

This assignment showcases the versatility of AI in adopting different personalities and providing tailored responses. It also emphasizes the importance of crafting precise system prompts to achieve the desired AI behavior.
